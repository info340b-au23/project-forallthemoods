        <h2>Problem & Data Domain</h2>
        <p>Our project centers on the world of music, specifically music discovery, a common passion that is shared by countless amounts 
            of people. When listening to music, people usually desire a personalized experience that resonates with their current state. 
            According to Neuroscientist Robert J Zatorre, music can influence and also reflect the emotions the user is feeling in their 
            current state, making it a formidable tool to enhance one’s emotional state (Zatorre & Salimpoor, 2013). 
            While existing platforms like Spotify and Apple music offer pre-made playlists with popular songs such as All The Feels or 
            Rap Caviar, they may not always provide the personalization and depth that users desire. The user also may not be able to 
            utilize these playlists since it may not be catered to their liking.</p>
        <p>To bridge this gap and elevate the music experience, our project aims to create a user-friendly and intuitive platform that 
            empowers users to explore music based on their emotional state. The challenge we aim to address in our project is to create a
            platform that is attuned to each user’s emotional state and ensuring that the music they discover is deeply personal. 
            Creating this platform includes curating mood-based playlists and developing and incorporating interactive elements and 
            visualizations that may improve the overall user’s experience.</p>
        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>Canadian rapper and vocalist–Drake, is one of the largest artists in the world, he is a household name to many whether you like hip-hop or not. 
            Drake is a name a vast number of people know. With our Drake promotional website any user is able to access such from any age range. 
            However, we believe that most of our users will be in the age ranges of 15-30, with the smaller minority being ages 30+. Users will most certainly 
            be fans of Drake’s music, or they are looking to discover more of his music and about his work! There may be some impacts our application may have 
            on minority groups in that those with no access to subscription programs like Spotify or Apple Music to have mood generated playlists can now access 
            our website for free to set a curated mood playlist that many would have to subscribe to obtain.</p>
        <p>Our Drake promotional website will be an interactive page for users to discover more about Drake, his music, and set a page mood based on users 
            preference, inspired by: <a href="https://drakerelated.com/rooms/lounge"> Drake Related.</a> On the homepage of our site, it lays out an image/outline of what we designed to be Drakes studio. Within the page, users will be 
            able to see and interact with certain objects and items within the room that will pop up/direct to a feature. Amongst the items within the homepage, 
            users will mainly be able to interact with the following items/objects; vinyls, record player, clothing piece (OVO hoodie), and window. 
            Users will be able to identify interactive items by a circle icon over each object. By hovering over these icons, texts will appear that state 
            what the feature the icon will direct to. By clicking the record player, users will be able to look through a selection of Drake's album, 
            leave a review/rate, or read other reviews/rates. Clicking the vinyls will give the option to take a quiz based on your knowledge on Drake and 
            based on the users answers, the quiz will generate “what type of Drake fan” is the user. Selecting the window will allow users to filter through 
            moods that will then generate a mood playlist of Drake's song. As well as, change the mood of the homepage by adjusting the lighting and overall 
            aura of the room. Lastly, selecting the OVO hoodie will direct users to Drake's OVO merch page. </p>
        <p>The users will be viewing information about Drake, including his songs, questions about the user for a quiz, a stagnant single user interface 
            that can be visually changed depending on the mood. Users will also be able to view playlists compiled of many different songs based on the selected mood. 
            Data will be collected and stored by user inputs, for example, writing from the reviews and the name of the user. Although there are many fan pages or 
            promotional pages for Drake, this website combines as both a way to discover fan features and to promote Drake's work. On our page, fans will be able 
            to implement their own reviews/rates and become a part of a community of other fans, while also being able to discover Drake's new music and merchandise. 
            It is a practical and convenient combination of both needs and allows users to discover other fun features in relation to their liking of Drake.
