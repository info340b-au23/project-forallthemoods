        <h2>Problem & Data Domain</h2>
        <p>Our project centers on the world of music, specifically music discovery, a common passion that is shared by countless amounts 
            of people. When listening to music, people usually desire a personalized experience that resonates with their current state. 
            According to Neuroscientist Robert J Zatorre, music can influence and also reflect the emotions the user is feeling in their 
            current state, making it a formidable tool to enhance one’s emotional state (Zatorre & Salimpoor, 2013). 
            While existing platforms like Spotify and Apple music offer pre-made playlists with popular songs such as All The Feels or 
            Rap Caviar, they may not always provide the personalization and depth that users desire. The user also may not be able to 
            utilize these playlists since it may not be catered to their liking.</p>
        <p>To bridge this gap and elevate the music experience, our project aims to create a user-friendly and intuitive platform that 
            empowers users to explore music based on their emotional state. The challenge we aim to address in our project is to create a
            platform that is attuned to each user’s emotional state and ensuring that the music they discover is deeply personal. 
            Creating this platform includes curating mood-based playlists and developing and incorporating interactive elements and 
            visualizations that may improve the overall user’s experience.</p>
