This repository contains code for an interactive Drake promotional web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. 

For All the Moods, is a promotional Drake website for fans and any users interested in the musical artist: Drake. Our page highlights interactive features for fans and users; discover new music from mood-playlists curated through our mood selector, leave album reviews/ratings, take a quiz to see what Drake persona you are, discover OVO merchandise, and sign-up for our page to save your progress. 

For All the Moods is inspired by Drakes recent album, 'For All the Dogs', in which our take is a turn on all the various moods Drake's music displays. Join us on For All the Moods to immerse yourself in the world of Drake, discover new music, share your thoughts, and connect with fellow fans. Join now and let the journey begin!
